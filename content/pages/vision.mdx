      # My Vision for Edmonton


      We know better, and now is the time to do better. Together, we can build a
      city that is safe, thriving, and inclusive. Here’s my vision:


      1. Tackling Homelessness with Compassion: It’s heartbreaking to see so
      many people living in encampments while billions are spent on projects
      that don’t address their urgent needs. Housing, addiction services, and
      mental health resources must become priorities.

      2. Supporting Our Children and Schools: Our children deserve smaller class
      sizes, better resources for educators, and access to essential services
      like speech, occupational, and physical therapy. Every child deserves the
      resources they need to reach their full potential and not be left behind.
      They are literally our future, and we must do more to set them up for
      success. This includes education on critical life skills, the dangers of
      drug use, and the impact of excessive screen time on social development
      and mental health. Together, we can equip our children with the tools they
      need to succeed.

      3. Protecting Seniors and Families: No senior, who helped build our city,
      should be forced to leave their home due to rising taxes. No family should
      have to work multiple jobs just to make ends meet. We need to ensure
      Edmonton is a city where everyone can thrive.

      4. Revitalizing Our Core and Infrastructure: Edmonton’s downtown and LRT
      systems should be places we are proud of.  Safe, clean, and welcoming for
      everyone. These spaces are vital to our city’s identity and economy.

      5. Easing Traffic Congestion: Traffic in Edmonton is becoming more and
      more clogged, making commutes frustrating and inefficient. We need smarter
      urban planning, improved traffic flow systems, and smarter investments in
      public transit to ensure people and goods can move freely throughout the
      city.

      6. Breaking Barriers to Business: Edmonton is full of talent, and we must
      reduce the restrictions and barriers to conducting business. Permits for
      construction and development shouldn’t take months. If city services are
      backed up, provisionary permits should be issued to allow projects to move
      forward while maintaining oversight. Streamlining bureaucracy will not
      only foster innovation and growth, but also help accelerate affordable
      housing projects to meet our city’s needs.

      7. Spending Responsibly: As a business owner, I’ve learned the importance
      of accountability. Every tax dollar must be spent carefully, focusing on
      projects that provide real benefits to Edmontonians.
