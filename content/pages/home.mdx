      Dear Fellow Edmontonians,


      I am not a career politician. My name is Dr. Omar Mohammad, a Pediatric
      Dental Surgeon, and I am honoured to call Edmonton my lifelong home. Born
      at the Misericordia Hospital in 1978, I’ve grown up in this city, lived
      its history, and experienced its triumphs and challenges firsthand.
      Edmonton isn’t just where I live; it’s where my soul belongs.


      I am selling my established practice to dedicate myself fully to running
      for and becoming your Mayor because I believe Edmonton needs leadership
      rooted in service, not politics. My experiences have prepared me for this
      challenge. I’ve seen what works and what doesn’t, both here and abroad.
      From providing free dental care to children on 11 international missions
      to raising millions through charity auctions, I’ve dedicated my life to
      giving back. Edmonton’s issues may be complex, but they are not
      insurmountable.


      I’m a proud Canadian of diverse heritage; Pakistani, Bengali, Scottish,
      Irish, and French Maritimer, and Proud Father of 4. My wife, a Lebanese
      farm girl from Northern Manitoba, shares a similar story of roots spread
      wide but a heart firmly planted in this city. Edmonton represents a blend
      of cultures, values, and dreams, and it’s where our family thrives.


      I’ve worn many hats in my journey: a newspaper carrier, mechanic,
      filmmaker, educator, business owner, and now a pediatric dental surgeon
      serving Edmonton’s youngest citizens. Every job, every experience has
      taught me one thing: Edmontonians are strong, resilient, and
      compassionate. This city is filled with talent, ambition, and heart. It is
      this spirit that I believe in, and it’s this spirit we must protect and
      nurture.


      However, Edmonton is at a crossroads. Encampments under bridges, growing
      homelessness, rising crime, reduced security, and overburdened
      infrastructure tell us that we’re not doing enough. For years, We’ve seen
      our city’s challenges grow. From increasing class sizes to seniors being
      taxed out of their homes. Our wait times in hospitals stretch on while our
      schools are overwhelmed. These issues don’t just require discussion; they
      demand action.


      We are seeing the effects of irresponsible overspending, which has led to
      deficit budgets, an increased debt burden, and unnecessary tax increases.
      This lack of fiscal responsibility impacts every Edmontonian, from
      families and individuals to local business owners, creating unnecessary
      hardships in an already challenging economic climate.


      We know better, and now is the time to do better. Together, we can build a
      city that is safe, thriving, and inclusive while staying fiscally
      responsible and accountable.


      Why I’m Running


      I’ve met with thousands of families in my career, listened to your
      concerns, and shared in your hopes. I understand what matters to us
      Edmontonian’s because I’ve walked alongside you, from the river valley
      trails to the clinic halls.


      It’s time for leadership that puts Edmonton first. Leadership that takes a
      common-sense approach, focusing on fiscal responsibility, reducing
      barriers, and prioritizing the needs of our people. Leadership that
      understands the struggles of homelessness, the pressures on families, and
      the importance of a thriving, connected community.


      We are the City of Champions. Let’s build a city where every person has
      the opportunity to succeed, where every neighborhood is safe, and where no
      one is left behind. Together, we can Champion a brighter, stronger future
      for Edmonton.


      It’s Time to Shine


      Let’s Shine Brighter Together!


      Sincerely,


      Omar Mohammad


      Candidate for Mayor of Edmonton
