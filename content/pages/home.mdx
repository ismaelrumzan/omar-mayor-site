      Dear Fellow Edmontonians,


      My name is Dr. Omar Mohammad, and I am not a career politician. I am a
      Pediatric Dental Surgeon, a proud father of four, and someone who has
      called Edmonton home since the day I was born at the Misericordia Hospital
      in 1978. I've grown up in this city, lived its history, and shared in both
      its triumphs and challenges. Edmonton isn't just where I live; it's where
      my soul belongs.


      I've worn many hats throughout my life: newspaper carrier, mechanic,
      filmmaker, educator, business owner, and now a specialist serving
      Edmonton's youngest citizens. Each of these roles taught me that
      Edmontonians are strong, resilient, and compassionate. This city is full
      of talent, heart, and ambition. That spirit is what I believe in and what
      I want to protect.


      I'm a proud Canadian of diverse heritage: Pakistani, Bengali, Scottish,
      Irish, and French Maritimer. My wife, Nadia, a Lebanese farm girl from
      Northern Manitoba, shares a similar story. Our roots span continents, but
      our hearts are firmly planted in Edmonton. Our family, like so many here,
      thrives in this incredible city built on cultural diversity and shared
      values.


      For years, I've given back through my work and volunteerism. I've provided
      free dental care on 11 international missions, raised millions through
      charity auctions, and contributed to addressing local needs here in
      Edmonton. These experiences, both local and global, have taught me what
      works and what doesn't. They've also shown me that Edmonton's issues,
      while complex, are not insurmountable.


      Today, I am selling my established dental practice to fully dedicate
      myself to running for Mayor of Edmonton. Why? Because I believe this city
      needs leadership rooted in service, not politics. Leadership that listens,
      acts, and delivers results with compassion, efficiency, and
      accountability.


      Right now, Edmonton is at a crossroads.


      Encampments under bridges, rising homelessness, and growing crime are
      clear signs that we're not doing enough. Our infrastructure is strained,
      our hospital wait times stretch on, and our classrooms are overcrowded.
      Seniors are being taxed out of their homes. These aren't just policy
      problems; they are human problems. And they require action, not endless
      debate.


      We are seeing the consequences of irresponsible overspending: ballooning
      deficits, mounting debt, and unnecessary tax increases. This lack of
      fiscal responsibility is hurting families, small businesses, and our local
      economy. It is creating barriers where there should be solutions.


      We know better. Now is the time to do better.


      Together, we can build a city that is safe, thriving, and inclusive while
      staying fiscally responsible and transparent. We can build a future where
      every neighborhood is secure, every resident is supported, and every
      taxpayer knows their dollars are being put to real use.


      Why I'm Running


      Throughout my career, I've met thousands of families. I've listened to
      your stories, your frustrations, and your hopes. I've walked the river
      valley trails and clinic halls right beside you. I understand what matters
      to Edmontonians because I've lived it.


      It's time for leadership that puts Edmonton first. Leadership grounded in
      common sense, focused on reducing barriers, managing finances responsibly,
      and prioritizing the needs of people.


      We are the City of Champions. Let's build a city where every person has
      the opportunity to succeed, where no one is left behind, and where our
      shared values drive smart, inclusive growth.


      Together, we can champion a brighter, stronger future for Edmonton.


      Sincerely,

      Dr. Omar Mohammad

      Candidate for Mayor of Edmonton
