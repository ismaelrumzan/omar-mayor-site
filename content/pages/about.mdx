      <Image src="/media/Omar for Mayor-1.jpg" alt="Omar Mohammad" />


      Omar Mohammad, born and raised in Edmonton, Alberta, is a devoted father
      of four and husband to his loving wife, Nadia. His life has been shaped by
      resilience, gratitude, and a commitment to serving others.


      Omar’s path has been built on hard work, and a focus on building
      meaningful connections. He began his academic journey at the University of
      Alberta and completed his pre-dentistry studies before graduating from
      dental school in 2009. His passion for helping children led him to
      specialize in pediatric dentistry, and he completed his residency in 2016.
      Since then, Omar has successfully established and managed 4 specialty
      dental practices, combining his clinical skills with a thoughtful
      understanding of efficient resource management and accountability, values
      he believes are essential to achieving sustainable growth in any
      organization.


      Through his work at the Alberta Surgical Centre, Omar has had the
      privilege of performing over 3,500 surgeries, helping patients receive the
      specialized care they need. He has also worked as a dentist at Alberta
      Hospital, providing essential dental care to individuals living with
      mental health challenges.


      Before becoming a dentist, Omar worked in a variety of roles that taught
      him the value of community and adaptability. From delivering newspapers
      and selling popsicles to working as a mechanic, filmmaker, and  educator,
      these experiences shaped his belief in lifelong learning and uplifting
      those around him.


      Omar’s childhood was marked by challenges, including frequent moves,
      periods of homelessness, and stays at Edmonton’s WIN House. He experienced
      food and housing insecurity firsthand while living in neighbourhoods like
      the downtown core and Belvedere. Despite these hardships, Omar credits
      Edmonton’s community resources and educational opportunities for helping
      him build a brighter future.


      Since 2008, Omar has participated in 11 international missions, providing
      free dental care and supporting sustainability projects in underserved
      communities around the world. Locally, he has raised millions for
      charitable causes through fundraising and his skills as a live auctioneer,
      which he has honed since 2013.


      As a pediatric dentist, Omar has been serving Edmonton’s youngest
      residents since 2016. Beyond his clinical work, he actively contributes to
      admission and fundraising committees and collaborates with local
      organizations to address homelessness in Edmonton.


      Omar is deeply grateful for the opportunities he’s had and is committed to
      giving back to the city that has played such a significant role in his
      life. He believes in thoughtful stewardship of resources and is guided by
      the principle that careful, accountable spending can help create thriving
      communities for all. His belief is that every challenge can become an
      opportunity to make a difference.
