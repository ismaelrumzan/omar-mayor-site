      ## This is Our Time


      Our city has so much potential, and together, we can make it shine
      brighter than ever. But We can’t do it alone, We need  people who care
      about Edmonton, who want to see our city thrive, and who are ready to roll
      up their sleeves and help make it happen.


      Whether it’s lending a hand at events, talking to neighbors, or helping
      share our message, every little bit makes a big difference. This campaign
      is about all of us and what we can accomplish together.


      It’s time to shine, Edmonton. Let’s shine brighter together!
