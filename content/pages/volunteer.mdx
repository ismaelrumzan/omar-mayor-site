      ## Why I’m Running


      I never thought I’d step away from my clinical practice, but I’ve felt an
      undeniable pull to do more for this city. For years, I’ve listened to the
      concerns of families in my clinic and my community. I’ve seen what works
      and what doesn’t, and I’ve come to realize that the skills and experiences
      I’ve gained can be used to make a bigger impact.


      From providing free dental care to children on international missions to
      raising millions through charity auctions and participating in
      sustainability and development projects, my life has been about serving
      others. Edmonton’s challenges are complex, but I believe that with strong
      leadership and a commitment to collaboration, they are not insurmountable.


      We are the City of Champions. Let’s build a city where every person has
      the opportunity to succeed, where every neighborhood is safe, and where no
      one is left behind. Together, we can champion a brighter, stronger future
      for Edmonton.
